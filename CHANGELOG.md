## [Upcoming]
- Further refinement and research into the initialization and indexing issues.

## [Known Issues]
- There are initialization errors with the language server that are currently
  unresolved. A future update by the language server may or may not resolve this
  issue.
- Nova doesn't display the completion hints very well, and some completions may
  not show at all, due to being overlaid by the suplemental information.
- Language server configurations are not not being detected, and currently fall
  back to defaults.
